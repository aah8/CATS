## Completed 

* Take "clean" audio file as input -- generated on computer so all pitches are perfect and there is no background noise. Recognize single notes and output names of those notes.
  * In MATLAB

* Recognize multiple notes
  * Harmonic removal algorithm

## Goals
  
* Recognize basic rhythms
  * Recognize complex rhythm
  * Recognize "dirty" audio files, taken from real recordings

## Requirements
 * Python 2.7
 * matplotlib
 * numpy

## FAQ
* Where are the examples? They are not included in the git repository. You have to run generateExamples.py to create them.
